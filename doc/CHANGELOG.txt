v1.2 10-Jan-2014
----------------
- ANY elements are now encoded/decoded.
- in some cases it could be favorable not to encode/decode elements of
  type any because it would involve big array copying. Therefor the
  compiler supports. The alternative element type called ANY_NODECODE
  which can be used inside the ASN.1 file in order to generate Java
  code that will not decod nor encode elements of these types.
- clarified licenses of dependencies.
- jasn1-compiler is now GPLv3 in order to compatible with Apache 2.0
  of BinaryNotes.
- jasn1-ber continues to be LGPLv2.1 or later
- libs are now in the central maven repository

v1.1.4 03-Jul-2013
------------------
- generated classes are declared final for better performance
- BerByteArrayOutputstream can be reset using reset() for reuse

v1.1.3 23-Aug-2012
------------------
- allow decoding of empty object identifiers

v1.1.2 14-Mai-2012
------------------
- improved efficiency in BerVisibleString
- modified BerBitString so it can be empty when decoded

v1.1.1 20-Feb-2012
------------------
- fix in BerIdentifier.decodeAndCheck(), thanks to Mr.Bostijancic from TU-Wien

v1.1.0 14-Feb-2012
------------------
- the default tagging can now be changed to implicit using the
  following kind of statement: SAMPLE DEFINITIONS IMPLICIT TAGS ::=
  ...
- the character '-' is now replaced by the '_' character in the name
  of Java classes
- support for indefinit length when decoding (not for encoding), has
  to explicitely enabled using the -il option
- SEQUENCE elements of type CHOICE that have not explicit tag are now
  supported by jASN1
- CHOICEs can now have sub CHOICES without tags. Only a warning is
  printed that this could one CHOICE could be integrated into another
  for better performance

v1.0.7 06-Feb-2012
------------------

v1.0.4 27-Jan-2012
------------------
- fixed bug in decoding of negative integers in BerInteger

v1.0.3 19-Jan-2012
------------------
- modified BerByteArrayOutputStream so its buffer and index are public and added two new constructors

v1.0.2 17-Jan-2012
------------------
- added BerBitString(byte[]) constructor

v1.0.1 13-Jan-2012
------------------
- fixed bug in coding of several byte length field

1.0.0 06-Dec-2011
-----------------
- added getByteBuffer() function for BerByteArrayOutputStream so arrays don't always have to be copied
- add code byte array and encodeAndSave function to all structures for better encoding performance when
  encoding the same structure several times 
- numerous bug fixes
- all basic types are now supported

0.9.0 21-Nov-2011
